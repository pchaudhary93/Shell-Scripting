Basics of Shell Scripting 


Bash Variables provide temporary storage for information.

Can be used within the lifespan of the program.

Two types of variables:

        System variables

        User defined variables

System Variables

Created and maintained by Linux Bash shell

Defined by Capital letters

Commonly used system variables are:

BASH_VERISON

HOSTNAME

HOME etc

User Defined Variables

Created and maintained by users

 Avoid uppercase for names of user defined variables

Easy to differentiate between user defined and system variables.

Unset

The value of a variable can be unset by using the unset command

The syntax for this is unset variablename

Global and Local Variables

In Shell script,

        User defined variables can be declared globally or locally

        By default, all variables are global

        So, their values remain the same inside and outside the function

Getting user input via keyboard

The read command

        Is used to accept input from the keyboard

        Can also be used to assign an input value to a user defined variable
