Case statement

The Bash shell has two forms of conditional statements

Case statement can be alternately used in place of if-else statement

Ls preferred when there are many items to select

Case: syntax

case $VARIABLE in

match_1) commands

;;

match_n) commands

;;

*) command_to_execute_by_default

;;

esac

Working of case statement

The variable is compared to

        Match_1
        Match_n

If one of these strings match VARIABLE, the commands until the ;; are executed

If neither match VARIABLE, the commands associated with * are executed

It is the default case condition because * matches all strings

Esac marks the end of case block
